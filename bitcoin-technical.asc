== About

BTChip is a USB smartcard/dongle dedicated to secure bitcoin transactions. It performs all sensitive cryptographic operations related to a bitcoin transaction (key generation & signature) onboard, and helps protect against malware in an untrusted environment by controlling the signed data.

== User validation

BTChip allows you to validate what you sign - i.e. check that you are paying the right amount to the right destination.

User validation is performed as follows : 

  - A specific status is returned to inform the user that a validation is pending  
  - The user unplugs the dongle 
  - The user plugs the dongle back into the computer (or a different computer / smartphone, tablet with USB host support, depending on how confident you are about the first computer integrity)
  - The dongle "types" (as a keyboard) a summary of the action to be validated and a 4 digits PIN to be entered, which is unique to the transaction
  - The user plugs the dongle back into the first computer (or just unplugs / plugs it again)
  - The user enters the PIN to confirm user validation

== Operation modes

Operation modes define which operations are allowed given the security environment the dongle is operating in.

Four operation modes are defined :

  - standard-wallet mode, managing an HD Wallet (BIP 32) with multiple accounts, supporting payments to a single address and enforcing user validation of the full transaction (unless the wallet is setup as a second factor for P2SH transactions). This mode is intended for all bitcoin users.
  - relaxed-wallet mode, managing an HD Wallet with multiple accounts, supporting arbitrary payments and enforcing user validation of the amount spent. This mode is intended for bitcoin users interested in drafting custom transactions with some level of control.
  - server mode, managing an HD Wallet with multiple accounts, supporting arbitrary payments and enforcing pre defined limits on the amount spent. This mode is intended for server operators using one or several BTChip dongles to secure their hot wallets.
  - developer mode, managing BIP 32 or regular private keys and allowing to sign arbitrary data. This mode is intended for bitcoin power users drafting custom transactions and only interested in private keys protection.

The dongle initally operates in standard-wallet mode when received (if this mode is enabled). The last chosen mode is restored when the dongle is powered on.

=== standard-wallet mode

Only a single point-to-point output (i.e. the standard script or a P2SH script) along with one change address is authorized. 

All transaction inputs are controlled by the dongle.

The change address index is automatically handled by the dongle and increased for each transaction to prevent address reuse. The change address index is shared for all accounts.

The standard script is coded as 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 [pubKeyHash] OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A P2SH script is coded as

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OP_HASH160 [script hash] OP_EQUAL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transaction are controlled by the user validation process. The following data will be prompted to the user : 

  - Amount to pay
  - Change amount
  - Fees

=== relaxed-wallet mode

Arbitrary output is authorized

Transaction inputs are only controlled if they use a key actually belonging to a wallet account.

Transaction are controlled by the user validation process. The following data will be prompted to the user : 

  - Amount to pay
  - A large warning that relaxed-wallet mode is in use

=== server mode

Arbitrary output is authorized

Transaction inputs are only controlled if they use a key actually belonging to a wallet account.

Transactions are controlled given user parameters and automatically signed if accepted.

Transactions can be controlled on a combination of the following parameters :

  - A cumulative maximum amount used in transactions
  - A maximum number of consecutive transactions before the dongle is removed
  
=== developer mode

Arbitrary data can be signed in this mode

Keys used in developer mode cannot be used in a different mode

== Lifecycle management APDUs

=== SETUP SECURE SCREEN

==== Description

This command is used to operate the dongle in a standalone terminal - instead of typing back second factor data to the user, it will be returned encrypted by the provided 3DES-2 key, which should be stored as securely as possible by the standalone terminal.

This command is mostly intended for demonstration purposes, and is used by the Prismicide prototype.

WARNING: This function is not supported in this version

=== SETUP

==== Description

This command is used to setup the dongle when received, or pre-issuance when using the forward setup mode. It must be executed on a trusted computer as security critical data is exchanged. 

For a new dongle not used as a backup device, a regular user will create a new random seed for a HD wallet and a PIN.

The PIN is used to perform a new payment transaction - it is sent as cleartext to the dongle and is not intended to be used as a malware protection method, only as an anti theft security. 
When generating a new seed in regular setup mode, the dongle types it on every other powerup until the PIN is entered, finishing with an 'X' to mark the end of the seed. It is recommended to do this on a different computer / device for maximum security before backing it up.

WARNING: When getting the seed backup, the string must begin with "Seed ", end with an X and be exactly 128 hexadecimal digits long (64 bytes). If not, you're missing either the beginning or the end of the seed and should retry until you see the whole seed.

In Point Of Sale setup mode, a PIN is exchanged between the user and the dongle. The seed is generated but not typed, and can be recovered through GET POINT OF SALE SEED commands. Until the encrypted seed is recovered, GET WALLET PUBLIC KEY is enabled without needing to enter the PIN. This mode is typically used for a service (such as a physical counter) offering prepaid dongles with KYC procedures and wanting to deliver a physical backup of the seed.

In forward setup mode, a secret PIN and a secret One Time Pad are exchanged between the user and the dongle. The seed is generated but not typed, and only GET WALLET PUBLIC KEY is enabled, without needing to enter the PIN. It is returned encrypted by the One Time Pad, so that only the user who generated the One Time Pad can decrypt it, and also typed after the first PIN entry. This mode is typically used for a service (such as a web shop or a vending machine) offering prepaid dongles and willing to provide the seed to the end user without compromising the security of the transactions.

After SETUP is performed, the dongle has to be reset to wipe out all parameters and start again - this can be achieved by entering the wrong PIN 3 times in a row.

A wipe PIN can be provided for plausible deniability - when entered instead of the regular user PIN, the seed is replaced by a random one and the device keeps operating.

It is recommended to store the BIP32 seed returned in the output of the SETUP command in a safe location for backup purposes - typically GPG encrypt it to yourself and store it on multiple storage devices / clouds.

  - An ECDH key exchange is performed on the user side using a newly generated keypair on the Bitcoin curve and the dongle Attestation public key - a 32 bytes secret is obtained, split into two 16 bytes components S1 and S2
  - S1 and S2 are XORed to produce a 16 bytes 3DES-2 session key
  - The following data is encrypted using 3DES CBC and the generated session key, and sent as password blob

'Additional description of setup parameters'

When enabled, RFC 6979 deterministic signatures will be used for all operations in wallet, relaxed wallet and server modes. RFC 6979 deterministic signatures are always available in developer mode. 

NOTE: Using deterministic signatures will make the signing process slower and could possibly create a larger side channel attack surface due to the way private keys are handled during the computation of the random value. We suggest to only enable this mode if you don't trust the chip hardware Random Number Generator or are sure of understanding the risks.

If generating a new seed, the dongle generates a 64 bytes random number from its hardware Random Number Generator

A keymap encoding is a set of Keyboard HID Usage IDs mapping the keyboard layout of the computer on which the user validation is performed. It can be updated later using the SET KEYMAP command.

=== VERIFY PIN

==== Description

This command is used to unlock the dongle using the PIN provided during setup.

If forward setup mode was used, the seed will be typed to the user on the first PIN entry and signature operations are enabled if a keymap was set. Otherwise the command will be denied.

The dongle must be physically reset after each invalid PIN to issue a new command.

After 3 invalid PIN submitted in a row, the dongle data is erased and it must be setup again.

If the wipe PIN is entered instead of the user PIN, the device seed is replaced by a random one and the device keeps operating.

If P1 is set to 0x80, the dongle returns the number of remaining attempts. Arbitrary data must still be sent (f.e. 1 byte)

=== GET TRUSTED INPUT

==== Description

This command is used to extract a Trusted Input (encrypted transaction hash, output index, output amount) from a transaction. 

The transaction data to be provided should be encoded using bitcoin standard raw transaction encoding. Scripts can be sent over several APDUs. Other individual transaction elements split over different APDUs will be rejected. 64 bits varints are rejected.

=== UNTRUSTED HASH TRANSACTION INPUT START

==== Description

This command is used to compose an opaque SHA-256 hash for a new transaction.

This transaction can be verified by the user and using transaction rules according to the current dongle operation mode.

If a new transaction is started, a VERIFY PIN command shall have been issued previously to unlock the dongle at least once following the dongle power up

The transaction data to be provided should be encoded using bitcoin standard raw transaction encoded as follows :

  - A 1 byte flag is added before each input in the transaction - if the input is passed as a Trusted Input, this flag is set to 0x01 - otherwise, it is set to 0x00. Non Trusted Inputs can be used in relaxed mode for inputs that are not signed, or for all P2SH inputs when the dongle has been setup to skip the second factor when dealing with P2SH inputs.
  - When using a Trusted Input, each input outpoint is replaced by the Trusted Input length (1 byte) and the Trusted Input data
  - The input scripts shall be prepared by the host for the transaction signing process as per bitcoin rules : the current input script being signed shall be the previous output script (or the redeeming script when consuming a P2SH output), and other input script shall be null. 
  - The encoded transaction data shall be provided up to (and not including) the number of outputs.
  - Scripts can be sent over several APDUs. Other individual transaction elements split over different APDUs will be rejected. 64 bits varints are rejected.

=== UNTRUSTED HASH TRANSACTION INPUT FINALIZE

==== Description

This command is used to compose an opaque SHA-256 hash for the transaction outputs

This command is rejected if all inputs advertised at the beginning of the transaction have not been processed first.

The generated script will be the standard script coded as below given the address for a non script address

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 [pubKeyHash] OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a P2SH script address the generated script will be 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OP_HASH160 [script hash] OP_EQUAL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The output amount, fees and change will be validated by the user in wallet or relaxed wallet modes.

The generated transaction output data contains in pre-serialized form the number of outputs (target & optionally change) and each output data

If a keycard seed has been provided and the wallet is operating in standard mode, an alternate second factor validation scheme is used, see <<Keycard>>

=== SIGN MESSAGE

==== Description

This command is used to sign a maximum 140 bytes long text message using a private key. The message must be ASCII printable (each byte of the message must be between 0x20 and 0x7e, both included)

The message is provided to the dongle, which types it along with a single usage transaction PIN when it's power cycled.

The transaction PIN is then sent back to this command to retrieve the message signature

The signature is performed as follows : 

  - The data to sign is the magic "\x18Bitcoin Signed Message:\n" - followed by the length of the message to sign on 1 byte (if requested) followed by the binary content of the message 
  - The signature is performed on a double SHA-256 hash of the data to sign using the selected private key

The signature is returned using the standard ASN-1 encoding. To convert it to the proprietary Bitcoin-QT format, the host has to : 
  
   - Get the parity of the first byte (sequence) : P
   - Add 27 to P if the public key is not compressed, otherwise add 31 to P
   - Return the Base64 encoded version of P || r || s

If the low end word of one component of the BIP 32 derivation path includes 0xB11D or 0xB11E the message is immediately signed without confirmation (typically used for BitID). The dongle must be powercycled after signing with a derivation path containing 0xB11D.

[[Keycard]]
=== FACTORY INITIALIZE KEYCARD SEED

==== Description

This command is used to replace the keyboard second factor by a printed keycard for regular (non relaxed) transactions

The keycard creates associates each ASCII character between 0x30 and 0x7a (included) to an hexadecimal digit, obtained by encrypting 00..50 by the 3DES-2 keycard seed key using CBC encryption, and considering each digit as an exclusive OR of both nibbles of each element

When using the keycard second factor, the user needs to provide as authentication code : 

  - Associated digits of the amount, including all decimal digits and the first N subsequent digits
  - Random A characters of the address (up to 10)
